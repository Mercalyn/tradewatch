global config.json:
-watch interval in seconds(should not affect backtesting speed)
-strat max open positions
-strat max equity stake
-strat max leverage, x:1
-strat min margin level req
-total list of possible instruments(currency pairs)(as determined in margin spreadsheet)
-simulation spread delta(dont need this since I'm plotting extreme bids and asks)




output strat charts:
-average / mean equity change per month
-


output strat nums:
-min, max, mean of the / ave equity change of all months
-total ending equity based on 10k


indicators:
-indicators are special because I am not calculating open and closes, only extreme highs and lows. each indicator will probably need 2 versions, a high and a low for a short and long respectively.
-rsi
-%bb
-sma's
-kvo(thinking not, because pulling volume may be difficult in currency)
-order book



other notes:
-custom quick-render chart based on high and low on both bid and ask. step line charts.
-db only stores raw data, high low bid ask orderbook, indicators for now are generated clientside to save server resources
-scale out positions: 1x, 2x, 4x, sma-20, sma-90
-scale out and close could be same loop, needs stop loss watch as well as its profit taking equivalents



loop:
-check mass update, mass indicator data update
-account financials, if can open any
-watch:
	-to open a trade
	-waiting on open trade
	-scale out
	-waiting scale/close trade
	-close(this is separate until I find a way to concretely flatten positions at the end)
-microserve html connects for data, charts


mass update, connect to last position data, increment by 1 hr candles and return limited number of update data, then loop will repeat it. unix timestamp is used here
mass update also holds the indicators


performance:
chart performance by setting sampleSize of labels,
data decimation with min/max preservation is an option
can also disable line drawing completely if enough data points



phases:
0-test local api node js
1-dl raw data, mass updater 1 hr
2-filled line chart outputs
3-strat inputs
4-live system
